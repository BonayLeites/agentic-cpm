# CPM Agent Accelerator

> A proof-of-concept multi-agent orchestration platform for Corporate Performance Management workflows.

---

## The Problem

Finance teams at mid-size to large companies spend days each month on manual close and performance reviews: loading trial balances from multiple entities, reconciling intercompany transactions, comparing actuals against budgets, and assembling narratives for different audiences. The work is repetitive, error-prone, and slow — even when the data is already in the system.

## What This Does

This PoC shows what CPM review workflows look like when orchestrated by a team of specialized AI agents. Two workflows are included:

| Workflow | What it reviews |
|---|---|
| **Consolidation Review** | Pre-close intercompany matching, anomaly detection, goodwill adjustments, multi-entity trial balances |
| **Performance Review** | Budget vs. actuals variance, gross margin decomposition, KPI breach detection, trend analysis |

Both workflows share the same orchestrator framework and produce structured findings, audit trails, and executive summaries — surfaced in a real-time frontend.

## Key Capabilities

### ⚡ Speed
Parallel agent execution surfaces findings in minutes. Steps 2 and 3 (IC matching + anomaly detection) run concurrently; subsequent agents build on their output. What took days of manual triage becomes a reviewable report at the end of a coffee break.

### 🔌 Extensibility
New workflows plug into the same orchestrator via a DAG configuration. New agents inherit `BaseAgent` and implement a single `execute()` method. The registry maps workflow types to ordered steps — add a step, change the order, or swap an agent without touching the orchestrator.

### 🔍 Traceability
Every tool call, LLM invocation, finding, and confidence score is persisted to the database. The Audit Trail screen exposes every step's inputs, outputs, duration, cost, and evidence chain. Nothing is a black box.

### ⚙️ Configurability
The orchestrator is model-agnostic. Business rules (materiality thresholds, breach percentages, DSO ceilings) live in a single source of truth and are passed to agents as configuration. Models can be swapped per agent independently.

## How It Works

         ┌────▼────┐
         │ Step 7  │  QualityGate   (reviews coherence, flags low-confidence items)
         └─────────┘
         SSE stream → frontend (real-time step events + heartbeat)
```

Agents downstream of Step 1 read all data from `AgentContext.memory` — the DataLoader is the single point of database access.

## The 5 Screens

1. **Home** — workflow selector (Consolidation Review / Performance Review)
2. **Workflow Run** — live timeline, activity log, and config side panel
3. **Findings** — collapsible cards with severity filter and confidence bars
4. **Executive Summary** — audience toggle (Controller / Executive)
5. **Audit Trail** — step table with expandable inputs, outputs, duration, and cost

The UI is fully internationalized (EN / ES / JA).

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Docker, Docker Compose, Azure OpenAI credentials.

```bash
# 1. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT and AZURE_AI_API_KEY

# 2. Start all containers (backend, frontend, PostgreSQL)
make up

# 3. Seed the database with NikkoGroup demo data
make seed

# 4. Open the app
#    Frontend: http://localhost:3000
#    API docs:  http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## Environment Variables

Place in `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@db:5432/cpm` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT` | _(required)_ | Azure AI Foundry endpoint URL |
| `AZURE_AI_API_KEY` | _(required)_ | Azure AI API key |
| `AZURE_AI_DEPLOYMENT_GPT4O` | `gpt-4o` | GPT-4o deployment name |
| `AZURE_AI_DEPLOYMENT_MINI` | `gpt-4o-mini` | GPT-4o-mini deployment name |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | `["http://localhost:3000"]` | Allowed CORS origins (JSON list) |

make test

# Lint + format check (ruff + mypy)
make lint

# TypeScript type check
cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit

## Infrastructure

Terraform modules under `infra/` provision the Azure resources needed for a cloud deployment: virtual network, Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server, container-based compute, and an Azure AI Foundry workspace. See `infra/README.md` for usage.

## Demo Data

The seed script populates a fictional group company, **NikkoGroup**:

- **NKG-JP** — Japan parent entity (JPY)
- **NKG-US** — US subsidiary, 100% owned (USD)
- **NKG-SG** — Singapore subsidiary, 80% owned (SGD)

Seeded data includes trial balances, intercompany transactions (with one intentional cut-off mismatch), exchange rates, journal entries, budgets, KPIs, and 7 knowledge pack documents.
